Examined Geographic Area:

The examined geographic area for this tile project is the contemporary United States, where I visualized a monochrome basemap, an alternative basemap visualizing general obesity rates, and finally, an alternative basemap depicting the income poverty ratio. The choropleth indicators convey the categorized severity of each geospatial dataset.



Zoom Levels:

The maximum zoom level for each tileset is between 2 and 5.



Brief Description of each Tile Set:

Tile 1: Basemap and Geospatial layer
This tile provides a satellite raster map layer of the United States along with a converted Geospatial dataset representing poverty rates throughout the United States. The choropleth indicators convey the severity of obesity rates from light red to dark red.

Tile 2: Basemap
This tile provides a satellite raster map layer of the United States used as a basemap for tile 1.

Tile 3:
This tile provides an alternative basemap along with the converted Geospatial dataset that represents obesity rates throughout the United States.

Tile 4:
This tile represents a alternative base raster map layer of the United States along with a converted Geospatial dataset representing a choropleth layer of the Income Poverty Ratio (IPR), where the severity of the greater poverty is conveyed from light to dark red.
