Examined Geographic Area:

The examined geographic area for this tile project is the contemporary United States, where I visualized a monochrome basemap, an alternative basemap visualizing general obesity rates, and finally, an alternative basemap depicting the income poverty ratio. The choropleth indicators convey the categorized severity of each geospatial dataset.

Zoom Levels:

The maximum zoom level for each tileset is between 2 and 5.
